# Ergo Pilot

Test your ergoscript using the same code conventions as in app-kit

## What code lives here?

This is a dummy attempt to refactor [ergo-playgrounds](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-playgrounds) to work with newest app-kit. 

##Â Why?

By introducing a `SimulatedContextBlockchain` we can test contracts with the same interfaces as we would do it in production.

## Why not just refactoring playgrounds?

This is just me discovering the existing codebase.  Hopefully this effort ends up in a PR to ergo's app-kit. Getting a PR merged there is much harder :) so I rather play here.
